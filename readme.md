# Predicting iris species using written from scratch Bayes classifier  
 Below is a plot showing the relationship between the *k* (number of folds) and the accuracy of the obtained result. It can be observed that with small number of folds, the train data set is not big enough for model to learn from. When *k* is equal or bigger than 4, training data set is large enough.  
 The accuracy for *k >= 4* is around 95%.
